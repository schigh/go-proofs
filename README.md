# go-proofs

Every developer carries with them, whether they are aware of it or not, a set of 
assumptions about their code.  These assumptions are either made from experience, 
instincts formed from using other languages, or were handed down to them by someone
else.

It is up to the developer to check themselves and do the work to make sure their 
assumptions are grounded in reality, or are just intuition (a nicer form of superstition)
or conjecture.

This is a set of assumptions about Go code, with evidence why the assumption is 
valid or invalid, and all the grey areas in between.  This is an open repository, 
and pull requests are encouraged.

Refutations and corrections are especially encouraged, and will be rewarded with 
coffee (assuming you have a [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/) account)
